# Python-Data-Science

Welcome to the Python-Data-Science repository! This collection of Python projects is based on courses I completed with IBM and Dataquest, focusing on data science and machine learning concepts. From fundamental Python programming to advanced machine learning algorithms, these projects showcase my learning journey and practical application of data science techniques.

## Introduction
This repository houses a variety of projects covering different aspects of data science, including data analysis, visualization, cleaning, and machine learning. Each project is a result of hands-on learning from courses offered by IBM and Dataquest, where I gained expertise in Python programming, data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling.

## Folder Structure
- **Python Introduction**: This folder contains projects that cover fundamental Python programming concepts.
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Explore projects focused on data exploration, visualization, and descriptive statistics.
- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Discover projects that demonstrate data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.
- **SQL**: Projects related to SQL databases, querying, and data manipulation tasks.
- **ML (Machine Learning)**: Explore machine learning projects built using Python libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
